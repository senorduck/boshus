  <p>Boshus is and will always be about a group of friends playing happy songs for each other and those who care to listen. The band was born out of illness strangely enough. Max had a bit of an "allergic reaction" to flu medicine and within the course of the week had a large array of pop songs written. One thing led to another, more layers and members were added and the rest is what you have here.</p>
